<h1>Database Query Tool</h1>

<p>The query tool is a place to view ad-hoc and custom reports that
have been installed on your website. When it starts, it presents you
with a list of reports. Click a report name to view that report.</p>

<p>The query tool tracks two kinds of saved report:</p>

<h2>Live Reports</h2>

<p>Live reports are run when you click the link. The report reflects
the current state of the database. Some of these reports may take a
while to run, so be patient if you see a spinner indicating that the
website is working.</p>

<p>Click the "new query" link to create a new live report. Live
reports are creating using the SQL database query language, so you
must know SQL in order to do this. Do not use this tool if you are
unfamiliar with SQL, as it talks directly to your database, and could
cause damage if you are careless with it.</p>

<p>If your live report works as expected, and you want to save it so
that you can run it again in the future, click the save report button,
and provide a report name to save it under.</p>

<p>When you are done with your saved live report, you can delete it
using the delete link. This only deletes the report, not the data used
to build the report.</p>

<h2>Saved Reports</h2>

<p>Some modules or other system components may generate offline
reports for later viewing. This is especially useful when reports take
a long time to generate, so it is better to pregenerate them
overnight.</p>

<p>Saved reports are pregenerated, so they are easy to view, and don't
create significant load on your website when you click on
them. However, the report reflects the state of the database when the
report was generated, not when you view it.</p>

<p>If you have any saved reports of this nature that you want
to include here, add them to the Query Tool configuration file like
so:</p>

<pre>
saved_reports = 1st report name
saved_reports += 2nd report name
saved_reports += another report name
</pre>

<p>These reports will then be included as options for viewing when you
launch the Query Reports tool.</p>
