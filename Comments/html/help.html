<h1>Comments</h1>

<p>The Comments provides system-wide access to comments that have been
posted in various places. This is useful for various purposes, such 
as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Summarizing recent comments received on a site, regardless of whether they
are posted in forums, blogs, or elsewhere.</li>
<li>Moderating new comments in a single place, rather than having to go to 
different plugins depending on where they were posted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Moderation</h2>

<p>When you launch the Comments plug-in, it displays all new comments
awaiting moderation. The buttons to moderate are at the bottom. (Click
"Goto bottom" to jump there):</p>

<ul>

<li>Approve &amp; publish - the selected comments are suitable for
publishing on your site</li>

<li>Reject - the selected comments should not be published. Rejected
comments are not deleted immediately, so by choosing this option, you
can in principle change your mind later, or simply keep the rejected
comment on file in case you want to archive abusive posts.</li>

<li>Delete - these are not good comments, and can be discarded
immediately.</li>

</ul>

<p>Check off all comments that should have the same moderation, and
then click the appropriate moderation button. Use check all and
uncheck all to quickly select or unselect all comments.</p>
