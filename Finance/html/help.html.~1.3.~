<h1>Financial Reports</h1>

<p>The Financial Reports module allows you to generate summary reports of 
your e-commerce activity. This gives you a high-level view of your website's
online sales. To view specific accounts, invoices, or payments, use
the Payments module instead. (Account names and invoice numbers in Financial
reports will link to the Payment module.)</p>

<p>All financial reports display summarized financial activity within
a date range. The date range is preset to the previous 30 days, but
can be set manually by entering your own date range. You can click on
the date icons to pick dates from a calendar.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>A <strong>sale</strong> or <strong>purchase</strong> is an invoice
that has been issued to one of your customers. It has not necessarily
been paid yet. We only include <strong>active</strong> invoices in these
reports.</p>

<p><strong>Revenues</strong> are actual <strong>payments</strong> that
have been received from your customers.</p>

<p><strong>Accounts</strong> are customers. Individual accounts may
make numerous distinct purchases in a time period. The
account <strong>balance</strong> is the difference between the
purchases (debits) and payments (credits) on the account.</p>

<h2>Report Types</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Purchases &amp; Payments</dt>
<dd>
This report summarizes each financial transaction known to the
system. Transactions are either debits (receivables, ie. invoices
issued) or credits (payments received). In the case of debits, the
report also tries to break the purchase down into the various account
codes so you can see in what areas the sales are occurring. Summary
totals are given at the bottom of the report; the total debits are the 
total sales made, and the total credits are the total payments received.
These may not balance perfectly if you received payments in the period 
for sales in an earlier period, or if you issued receivables in the 
period that were not paid in that period.
</dd>
<dt>Sales (purchases only)</dt>
<dd>This report displays sales only, ie. your receivables for the period.
Sales are summarized, which means you see invoice totals, and account code 
subtotals only. Individual line items are not reported (although you can 
click the invoice number to view them). No payment information is included.
</dd>
<dt>Itemized Sales</dt>
<dd>
Itemized sales breaks each sale down into its specific line items so
that you can see in detail exactly what the individual charges
were. It does not include any payment information.
</dd>
<dt>Revenues (payments only)</dt>
<dd>
This report display all payments received in the time period. Payments
are always associated with an account, and might also be associated
with a particular invoice. However, some payments are not connected to
an invoice (eg. a payment toward an outstanding account
balance, which might be related to several invoices).
</dd>
<dt>Itemized revenues</dt>
<dd>
This report is similar to itemized sales, but we only report the line
item if a payment was received on the invoice. The revenue reported will
be accurate if the invoice was paid in full, but not if the payment was
only a partial payment (since in that case we cannot tell which of the 
items should be considered paid or not), nor if payments were received
on an account, but not applied directly to an invoice. It gives the best
results for e-commerce payments, since those tend to be paid in full at
the time of purchase.
</dd>
<dt>Account Activity</dt>
<dd>
Account activity summarizes all purchases and payments made by each
account that had activity in the time period. Individual purchases or
invoice numbers are not shown, because there could be many in the
given time period. The values shown are subtotals of all invoices and
payments in that time. An account credit is a payment from that
account, and an account debit is a receivable due from that account. A
negative balance, therefore, is an amount owing to you from the
account holder.
</dd>
<dt>Daily Summaries</dt>
<dd>
The daily summaries report shows subtotals of your sales (broken out
by account code) and revenues for each day in the reporting period.
The report also includes some charts to display this information graphically.
</dd>
<dt>Monthly Summaries</dt>
<dd>
The monthly summaries report shows subtotals of your sales (broken out
by account code) and revenues for each month in the reporting period.
The report also includes some charts to display this information graphically.
</dd>
</dt>

<h2>Report Details and Options</h2>

<p>When reports show specific invoice numbers or account names, those
may be linked to the Payment module. You can use this to inspect
account or invoice data in more detail. The Payment module will show
everything that it knows about the invoice or account requested; it
will ignore the parameters of the particular financial report you are
viewing (such as the date range).</p>

<p>All reports are exportable to CSV or Excel format.</p>
