<h1>Content Management</h1>

<p>The Content Management tool provides a general-purpose interface to
all content management functions in the system. It allows you to
inspect and modify all content items, no matter what type.</p>

<h2>The Browser</h2>

<p>The browser is an exapndable tree view of all of your content. The
top elements will be website sections, and nested under these will be
pages, libraries, blogs, and so on. Click on the leftmost arrow to
open up an item and expose the items that are contained within it.</p>

<p>The browser shows:</p>

<ol>
<li>content type and ID</li>
<li>content name (as displayed in the URL)</li>
<li>posting date (if applicable)</li>
<li>number of items it contains</li>
<li>access restrictions</li>
<li>content role</li>
<li>whether this content is hidden in any way</li>
<li>language</li>
<li>status</li>
</ol>

<p>Click on the content name to inspect and manage that content
item. This will open up an overlay window to work on that content.</p>

<p>If the content is of a type that has its own specialized plug-in
for content managment, that plug-in icon will also be shown to the
right of the name. Click on that icon to launch the plug-in.</p>

<p>If you create new content, it will not automatically appear in the
browser. You need to refresh/reload to see it.</p>

<h2>The Inspector</h2>

<p>When you click on a content item in the browser, an inspector
overlay window opens to view that content in detail. You can close the
inspector window by clicking on the close tab at the upper right.</p>

<p>The inspector window contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>a pathbar showing your current location; click on any item in the path to change to that location</li>
<li>a menubar with numerous operations you can perform on the current content</li>
<li>a workarea displaying the currently selected operation</li>
</ul>

<a name=contents></a><h3>Contents</h3>

<p>The contents view shows all sub-content items under the selected
item, in the form of icons, which may represent content-types,
mime-types, or even thumbnails, as appropriate. Click on any icon to
visit that content item.</p>

<p>The contents view will also show an icon representing revisions of
the current content, if there are any. Clicking on this will take you
to the <a href="#revisions">revisions</a> too.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=preview></a><h3>Preview</h3>

<p>The preview shows you an administrator preview of the content. The
preview can vary, depeding on the content type. It is not necessarily
the same view that the public seems (although the preview may also
provide links to the public view).</p>

<p>For basic content, it will display multiple views in both regular
and source form.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=info></a><h3>Info</h3>

<p>The info screen displays a variety of technical information about
the content, including its configuration, paths, views, and
revisions.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=conf></a><h3>Configure</h3>

<p>The configure screen allows you to reconfigure the content, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Title - used in headings and page titles</li>
<li>Label - used in links, menus, and indexes</li>
<li>Name - used in URLs, for example http://example.com/parent/<b>name</b></li>

<li>URL - specify a custom URL here. This URL will be used in all
links to the content. <span class="warn">Be careful! Just because you put an URL here
does not mean your web server will understand your intention.</span> You can
use this to specify an off-site URL at another website, or you can use
it to specify a specialized URL at your own website, but in the latter
case, you must also ensure that your webserver is configured to
recognize and process that URL (such as through a 301 redirect).</li>

<li>Parent - the determines where in the site this items resides. Be
careful when you move items around using this field, as not every
location necessarily makes sense, and it might be hard to find your item again
if you misplace it.</li>

<li>Template - when displayed in a page-like format, use this
template. It is not necessary to specify this in most cases, since the
system can usually guess a good template to use.</li>

<li>Original - some content (for example translations, and aliases)
are alternative representations of other items in the system. The
original field points back to the original content. In other cases, it
should be left blank (or zero).</li>

<li>Language - if this content is in a language other than the
default (which is usually English), specify that here.</li>

<li>Sortkey - this is an alphanumeric code that is used to sort this
content relative to its siblings. It sorts alphabetically and is
case-sensitive, so "aaa" comes after "ABC", and "10" comes before
"2". Good practice is to use uppercase alpha keys, and include leading
zeros on numeric keys so that they will sort consistently. Names
should be ordered so that they sort by the apprpropriate part of the
name. For example "SMITH JOHN", and "0042". Note that not all content
is sorted by its sortkey. Blog posts and events are typically sorted
by date instead, for instance. In those cases, sortkey will be
ignored. The <a href="#order">order</a> tool provides a simple user
interface for manually sorting, if you do not want to manage your
sortkeys individually.</li>

<li>Access - determines who is permitted to view this content.</li>

<li>Hide from - content will automatically be included in menus,
sitemaps, indexes, and other places. These checkboxes allow you to
optionally hide it from those places.</p>

<li>Content role - this determines who may manage this
content. Editorial content is the actual information that website
visitors come to consume. Design content consists of the auxiliary
styles, images, and media that are used to decorate
pages. User-originated content comes from your website visitors.</li>

<li>Publish rule - determines how this content gets published for faster performance.
<ul>
<li>static - fast, but visiable to everyone</li>
<li>dynamic - slow, but personalizable for each visitor (including blocking view for unprivileged viewers)</li>
<li>hourly, daily, weekly - like static, but automatically republishes at intervals to stay fresh</li>
<li>never - does not publish</li>
</ul>
You do not need to set the publish rule. The system can figure out for
itself what the best publish rule is. Only set this if you need to
override the system's choice.</li>

<li>Status - the current <a href="#workflow">workflow</a> status.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, any special <a href="#metadata">metadata</a> that is
pertinent to this type of content will also be included on the
configuration screen.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=update></a><h3>Update</h3>

<p>Updating content is how you change the content <em>as it appears to
the website visitor</em>. It basically involves adding a
new <a href="#revision">revision</a>.</p>

<p>There are five ways to update the content:</p>

<ul>

<li>HTML - allows you to enter/edit formatted text content using a
WYSIWYG editor with various formatting tools.</li>

<li>Text - allows you to enter/edit unformatted text and raw code,
including HTML and CSS.</li>

<li>File - upload a file. If you upload an image, it will give you
options to automatically scale it to other sizes.</li>

<li>URL - you can specify a hard URL to this revision. Be careful, as
this puts control of the content outside the CMS, and it could move or
disappear without notice.</li>

<li>Path - you can specify a path (on your webserver) to a file that
should be used for this new revision.</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=metadata></a><h3>Metadata</h3>

<p>The metadata screen lets you edit any metadata associated with this
content. Generic metadata (applicable to all content types)
includesthe Dublin Core metadata standard. Metadata that is specific
to each content type may also be included. Metadata is, generally
speaking, optional in most cases.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=order></a><h3>Order</h3>

<p>This tool gives you an easy way to re-order content. The contents
of this item are listed, and you can drag them into the correct order,
then click the "save order" button.</p>

<p>This has the effect of setting the sortkey in each sorted item's
configuration, using a numeric sortkey with leading zeros, such as
"0002".</p>

<p>Note that order may be ignored by some types of content. (Event
calendars are ordered by date, for example, regardless of which order you put
the events in.)</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=price></a><h3>Price</h3>

<p>The price tool lets you manage the prices of this item. You can
define any number of prices, with various conditions, including the
dates during which the price is valid, and the access level needed to
get that price.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the system will choose the cheapest price that a
particular user is eligible for.</p>

<p>Only some content types have e-commerce functionality; prices will
be ignored for other types of content.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=schedule></a><h3>Schedule</h3>

<p>The schedule screen allows you manage dates that are associated
with this item. This can include calendar entries, scheduled tasks,
to-do lists, and log entries.</p>

<ul>

<li>Tasks - tasks are automatic jobs that you can schedule to run in
advance. Type the job command into the description field (allowed
commands are shown below). The job will run on the specified date,
unless you choose hourly, daily, or weekly, in which case it will run
regularly between the start and end date.</li>

<li>To-do - to-do items are manual jobs related to this content that
you can remind yourself to do on the specified date. An e-mail will be
sent on that date to remind you of this job, and you can also use the
ToDo plugin to manage your outstanding items on the to-do list.</li>

<li>Log - the log is just a journal of notes on this content.</li>

<li>Calendar - calendar dates are used by items like events to place
themselves on a calendar.</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=tags></a><h3>Tags</h3>

<p>Content can be tagged with various keywords, allowing it to be
indexed by topic, or given special prominence in search indexes under
those keywords.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=translations></a><h3>Translations</h3>

<p>The CMS supports any number of languages. If you are maintaining
mirrored content (ie. each content item is duplicated in each of your
supported languages), the translations tool can help to maintain the
various translations.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=revisions></a><h3>Revisions</h3>

<p>Every time you <a href="#update">update</a> content, you create a
new revision. Previous revisions are not lost, but are kept on file
indefinitely, allowing you to go back and find old
versions, <a href="#rollback">roll back</a>, or see what changes were
made. The revisions tool lets you inspect all of the revisions of the
selected content item.</p>

<p>Each revision is summarized with information about the revision,
including a change note that gets recorded when
you <a href="#update">update</a> the content. You also have the
following tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>preview - this lets you view the revision directly</li>
<li>changes - this will display the differences between this revision and the previous one. (Requires the String::Diff module to be installed on your server.)</li>
<li>restore - this will restore the selected revision to the most current position, effectively updating the content with an old version. It copies the old revision, so the original revision remains in place.</li>
<li>delete - old revisions that are no longer needed can be deleted here. If you delete the top revision, you are effectively doing a <a href="#rollback">rollback</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=rollback></a><h3>Rollback</h3>

<p>This deletes the most recent revision of this content, effectively
restoring the previous revision. This is how you "undo" content
updates.</p>

<p>If you want to "undo" a rollback, you have to find the deleted
revision in your trash, and restore it from there.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=workflow></a><h3>Workflow</h3>

<p>The workflow status of the content determines where it is in the
process of "going live". You can update the workflow status of the
current content, and/or its contents.</p>

<p>Workflow status can be one of:</p>

<ul>

<li>published - live content, visible to your website visitors</li>

<li>archived - old content, still visible, but no longer active. Use this when content is no longer relevant, but you do not want the old links to break.</li>

<li>queued - in the publish queue, to be publised in turn sometime in the near future (depends on your queue settings).</li>

<li>approved - this content is ready to go live, can be published manually.</li>

<li>submitted - content is waiting for approval from a moderator</li>

<li>draft - content is still being worked on</li>

<li>expired - content is out of date, and is no longer available, but might be republished later</li>

<li>canceled - content is out of date, and is no longer relevant or available.</li>

<li>rejected - content was rejected by a moderator, and might be removed.</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that the <a href="#publish">publish</a> tool will
automatically move a content item to a published status.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=todo></a><h3>Todo</h3>

<p>This adds a task to the to-do list for this
item. See <a href="#schedule">schedule</a> for more information.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=keys></a><h3>Keys</h3>

<p>The keys to this content determine who is and is not permitted to
manage it. Keys can be issued for any content item. Typically they are
issued for sections, and they automatically apply to all of the
contents, but you can also make keys for specific content items if you
need more detail in your access controls.</p>

<p>The <b>keyring</b> is the complete set of keys that apply to the
current content. It will include general purpose keys for the section,
as well as more specific keys.</li>

<p>Click the + tool to make a new key. The key can be issued to a
particular administrator, or to a group. The key specifies that that
person or group can act in certain roles (such as editor, designer,
moderator, etc). This determines which management operations they are
allowed to perform on the content. Lastly, you need to specify the key
type. <b>Grant</b> gives permission, and <b>revoke</b> takes
permissions away.</p>

<p>The roles are:</p>

<ul>

<li>editor - editors can update and configure editorial content, and create new content items.</li>

<li>designer - designers can update and configure design content, and create new content items.</li>

<li>administrator - administrators can delete, publish, configure, and create content</li>

<li>reviewer - reviewers can moderate (approve/reject) submissions</li>

<li>owner - owners can update/revise content</li>

</ul>

<p>To give someone permission to edit pages, but not to take those
those changes live, their key should have an editor role only. If
someone is there to do web design, but should not be posting articles
or content, their key should have a design role only. If someone is in
an executive position to make decistions about what goes live when,
but is not otherwise involved in content production, their key should
have an administrator role only. If someone needs to approve
user-contributed content, but should not otherwise be making content
contributions to the website, their key should have a reviewer role
only.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can select multiple roles.</p>

<p>Note that some notification emails will be sent to the website
owner. If you want to force this to a particular user, make sure their
keys sets them as an owner of the section.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=newcontent></a><h3>New Content</h3>

<p>This will create new content underneath the current content
item. Creating content happens in 2 steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>name the content, and declare its type</li>
<li>configure the content</li>
</ol>

<p>This creates an empty content object, which you can work on further
using the regular content management tools (such as by updating it,
then publishing it).</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=copy></a><h3>Copy</h3>

<p>The copy function clones the currently selected content. The new
content will have the same name, with <code>_copy</code> appended. It
will be a sibling to the content you started from (ie. both will be
visible from the <a href="#contents">contents</a> view of the
parent). Click into the copied content to reconfigure and update it to
suit. For instance, you should rename it to something more meaningful
than <code><em>OLDNAME</em>_copy</code>.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=publish></a><h3>Publish</h3>

<p>Publishing takes content live. It sets the workflow status to
"published", and writes out any static files that need to be published
for performance reasons.</p>

<p>Publishing options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast - skips publishing anything that already appears to be published. Use this for minor updates.</li>
<li>Force - publishes files regardless of whether they already appears to be published. Use this when fast publishing overlooks your changes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>This item only - publishes only the currently selected content. Use this for minor updates, when menus and indexes are not expected to change.</li>
<li>Item, contents, and container - publishes this content, and everything else that touches it. Use this for new posts that will affect menus and indexes on other pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, when menus or sidebars are affected across the
entire website, it is a good idea to also republish the section.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=unpublish></a><h3>Unpublish</h3>

<p>Unpublish removes any static files that were written out for this
content. This may cause <em>404 Not Found</em> errors for some
links. That may be what you want, however, when content has to be
taken off-line.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>

<a name=delete></a><h3>Delete</h3>

<p>Deleting content does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>unpublishes any static files associated with this item</li>
<li>removes all of its revisions</li>
<li>deletes the content item from the CMS</li>
<li>does the same for each of the contents. <span class=warn>This can potentially remove a lot of content.</span></li>
</ul>


The info screen displays a variety of technical information about
the content, including its configuration, paths, views, and
revisions.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>


<a name=search></a><h3>Search</h3>

<p>Search lets you find content anywhere in the CMS. There are several
ways to search:</p>

<ul>
<li>find content by name/title</li>
<li>search through metadata</li>
<li>use the search index to find specific terms</li>
<li>search all revisions/views (this can be used to find old content that is no longer live)</li>
<li>resolve content - this searches for content in the same way that the templating system does. That is, it finds the best instance of a given content name to use in the current context.</li>
</ul>

<p>In each case, click on the search results to jump to that content.</p>

<p><a href="#menu">&lt; back</a></p>
