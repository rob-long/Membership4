The Donation plug-in is a simple tool to solicit a donation amount and
add it to the user's shopping cart.

To run a fundraising campaign, add the following parameters to your
Donation configuration file:

campaign_start = YYYY-MM-DD
campaign_goal = nnnnn.00

This will allow the Donation plug-in to display a fundraising gauge,
based on donations received since the start date. To insert a gauge 
into a page, use the module parameter "gauge". You can also customize
the width of your guage, using the configurating setting:

gauge_width = 400
