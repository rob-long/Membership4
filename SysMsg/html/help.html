<h1>System Messages</h1>

<p>This plug-in module allows the system administrator to customize
system messages that are printed out by various components and
plug-ins.  System messages are those messages and other strings of
text that are "hard-coded" in the system and not managed using CMS
tools like regular content is.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<p>Your system can support any number of alternate languages. If there
is more than one choice, you will be asked to choose a language to
work with when you start. Otherwise, the second language will be
chosen for you automatically.</p>

<p>If you need to change the languages that your system supports,
follow these instructions:</p>

<h3>Allowed Languages</h3>

<p>Your list of alternate languages is taken from the datatype
<code>list:version</code>, which is defined in
<code>cgi-bin/dbmap/.datatype</code>.  Add a line to this file (or
edit the existing line), with three tab-delimited fields like
this:</p>

<pre>
list:version	select	Français
</pre>

<p>The last field lists the <em>alternate</em> languages available. (Do
not include English in this list.) This example adds only a single
language, so it sets up a bilingual site in English and French.  If
you want more than two languages, add more to the end of this line,
separated by the bar character "|".  There is no limit to the number
of languages that you can support, for example:</p>

<pre>
list:version	select	Français|Español|Deutcsh
</pre>

<p>If the language names require non-ASCII characters, add them to this
file in the same character encoding you use for ExSite.  This is UTF-8 by
default (although you can use any character encoding by setting the
configuration parameter <code>charset</code>). For example, to support 
French, Chinese, and Russian:</p>

<pre>
list:version	select	Français|中文|русский
</pre>

<h2>Building a message dictionary</h2>

<p>Now you should put the system into another language mode so that it
will try to use messages in the alternate languages.  There are two
ways you can change the language mode:</p>

<ol>

<li> Create pages in those other languages.  (Set the pages'
version/language to one of your selected languages, and then interact
with ExSite and your plug-ins through those pages.)</li>

<li> Change the system's default language.  (Set the configuration parameter 
<code>default_version</code> to one of your selected languages, and then
interact with the administrator tools.)

</ol>

<p>Every time the system tries to output a system message in one of
your alternate languages, but cannot find an appropriate translation,
it falls back on the English version, and logs the message in the
message dictionary for the attention of a translator.  This means that
you simply have to use your system for a while, and it will
automatically log for translation every message that sees common
usage.</p>

<p>In administrator control panels, failed translations are
highlighted <span style="font-style:italic; border-bottom:1px dotted
red;">like this</span> so you can spot new translatables as they
appear.  You can add a CSS class "NoTranslation" to your website
stylesheet if you would like the same feature on your regular
webpages.</p>

<h2>Translating</h2>

<p>Once you have accumulated a good number of messages in your
translation logs, you can use the <strong>System Messages</strong>
plug-in to perform your translations.</p>

<p>Launch the plug-in, select the language/version you want to
translate, and it will show you a list of messages that it has tried
unsuccessfully to translate into your preferred language.  Click on
the update buttons to translate each message.</p>

<p>The translation form shows the default (English) message, with a
text area to enter the equivalent in your selected language.  After
you submit a translation, it will disappear from the to-do list of
required translations, and you can move on to another message. (You
can still find the translated message under "All Translations".</p>

<h3>Templated Messages</h3>

<p>Some messages contain tags to insert other data.  These might look
something like this example:</p>

<pre>
Please contact the system administrator, at [[admin_email]].
</pre>

<p>That means that some other data (in this case, an email address)
will be substituted into the <code>[[admin_email]]</code> position of
the message at a later time.  When translating such messages, <u>do
not translate/change those tags</u>, or the system will not know where
to put the data.</p>

<h3>Maintenance</h3>

<p>The procedure above will identify the most-viewed messages quickly,
but some rare messages (especially error messages) will get missed.
Over time, ExSite will slowly uncover more of these messages.
Whenever a new message is found, it will be displayed in the special
style that indicates a missing translation.  You can take this as a
hint that you or your translator can visit the System Message plug-in
to touch-up the translations.</p>

<p>If you ever need to correct or update a translation, simply use the
search tool in the System Messages control panel to find the message
of interest.</p>

<p>If system messages get changed or updated, they will usually appear
as entirely new messages in the dictionary, requiring translation all
over again.</p>

<h2>Coding for Internationalization</h2>

<p>Code must be written to support internationalization to make use of
this feature.  If not, then the messages will only output in their
original hard-coded version.  If you see a message on a system screen in
the wrong language, then it supports internationalization if it has
been restyled to indicate a missing translation.</p>

<p>To upgrade messages in the code to support internationalization,
simply enclose the message string in <code>$msg{...}</code>.  For
example, the old message:</p>

<pre>
return "Permission denied - you do not appear to be logged in!";
</pre>

<p>should be rewritten as:</p>

<pre>
return $msg{"Permission denied - you do not appear to be logged in!"};
</pre>

<p>To allow for messages that include substituted values from external
sources, you can use a method like this:</p>

<p>Old:</p>
<pre>
return "Please contact the system administrator, at $admin_email."
</pre>

<p>New (method 1):</p>
<pre>
return $msg{"Please contact the system administrator, at"}." ".$admin_email;
</pre>

<p>New (method 2, using <code>ExSite::Misc::substitute()</code>):</p>
<pre>
return &substitute(
          $msg{"Please contact the system administrator, at [[admin_email]].",
          { admin_email => $some_email_address }
       );
</pre>

<p>Method 1 gives the translator a sentence fragment to
translate. Sometimes this can be insufficient to make a good
translation, especially if the sentence structure should be different
in the other language.  The 2nd method will appear as a more complete
message in the translation tools, with substitution fields clearly
marked.  This may give the translator more flexibility for a correct
translation.</p>

<p>In any case, do not include the actual substituted values in
<code>$msg{...}</code> or you could end up with many variations on a
single message, all requiring individual translation.</p>
