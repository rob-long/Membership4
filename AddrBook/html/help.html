<h1>Address Book</h1>

<p>Your Address Book is a database of all the people and places your
website knows about. These can come from several sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>e-commerce customers</li>
<li>membership systems</li>
<li>event registrations</li>
<li>contact list imports</li>
<li>subscriptions</li>
<li>other...</li>
</ul>

<p>Those different subsystems have their own methods of collecting
contact information. They will all store them in the central Address
Book.  Some of the applications may provide their own interfaces to
managing their contacts, but the Address Book application gives you a
single place where you can search and manage all of these various
contacts. </p>

<h2>About Address Cards</h2>

<p>An <em>address card</em> is like a business card. It provides a
complete set of contact information for a certain person/context. A
person or place may have several cards for different situations. For
example, a person may have the following address cards:</p>

<ul>
<li>home</li>
<li>school</li>
<li>work</li>
<li>shipping address</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these could provide different street addresses, phone
numbers, email addresses, and so on, for that particular context. All
of them ultimately refer to the same person, however.</p>

<p>Each address card also has a privacy setting, which determines who
can view that personal information:</p>

<ul>
<li>public - it is okay to show this information to anyone</li>
<li>members - only show this information to authenticated users</li>
<li>administrators - only show this information to the website owners</li>
</ul>

<p>If an individual wants to display their home email to members, but
not their home phone number, they can add two different cards with
different privacy settings. More private information can be excluded
from the cards with more open privacy settings.</p>

<h2>Searching the Address Book</h2>

<h3>Browse</h3>

<p>To browse by letter, go to <strong>Browse</strong>, and choose the
appropriate letter to view all contacts under it.</p>

<h3>Find</h3>

<p>To search by name, email, or phone number, go to <strong>Find</strong>
and select the appropriate tab.</p>

<h3>Locations</h3>

<p>To view locations only, go to <strong>Locations</strong> to view a 
complete listing.</p>

<p>Note that locations are typically used as event venues, or business
locations. In addition to contact information, you can also provide a
lengthly text description, an image, a brochure (or other downloadable
file), and longitude/latitude coordinates (which can be used for
mapping apps).</p>

<h2>Advanced Search</h2>

<p>The advanced search function uses various special algorithms to
identify different types of person or place in your address book, and
lets you filter them in different ways. The different types are:</p>

<ul>
<li> users - people who can log in to your website</li>
<li> members - people who have a membership with your organization</li>
<li> member groups - eg. committees, teams</li>
<li> registrants - people who have registered for events</li>
<li> customers - people who have purchased something from your site</li>
<li> locations - places, not people</li>
<li> other</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that these categories can overlap. For example, a member will
also be a user if they can log in to your website. They will be a
customer if they have ever paid for anything through the website. They
will also be a registrant if they have ever signed up for an
event.</p>

<p>When performing an advanced search, you can select some parameters
related to the type of contact you have selected, including
restricting the geographic location to a particular city,
province/state, or country. You also have the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li> select a particular type of address card (eg. work addresses only)</li>
<li> select all matching address cards, or one only per person 
(the best or most complete one)</li>
<li> include or exclude address cards that have been explicitly flagged 
as being unsubscribed from bulk communications</li>
</ul>

<h3>Saving Contact Lists</h3>

<p>After performing an advanced search, you can export the resulting
data to .xls or .csv format, for use with other programs.</p>

<p>You can also save the result to a contact list that the system will
remember. Saved lists can be recalled at any time under
the <strong>Saved Lists</strong> button. Note that the system saves
the search parameters, not the exact list of contacts. That means that
when you revisit a saved list, you get the <em>updated</em> list of
who matches that search.</p>

<h3>Combined Searches</h3>

<p>You can create contact lists with different combinations of searches 
by combining those searches in the following way:</p>

<ul>
<li> Create and save a search using the method above</li>
<li> Start a new advanced search, and select your saved search as a 
starting list. Your new search parameters will add to this list.</li>
<li> You can save and add to this newest search as well.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Importing New Contacts</h2>

<p>Other plugins automatically import contacts into the Address Book
when they receive them. To manually import contacts, you can enter
them individually through the <strong>Add Contact</strong> button, or
through a bulk CSV upload using the <strong>Import</strong>
button.</p>

<h3>Administrator-only Fields</h3>

<ul>
<li>Account - if this address card belongs to an existing member or customer, 
include their account number here. Do not specify a name if there
is an account number, since we can get the name from the account.</li>
<li>Location - if this address card belongs to an existing location, 
select that location here. You do not need to specify a name if there
is a location, since we can get the name from there.</li>
<li>Subscribed - select Y if this contact info can be used for bulk communications, N otherwise.</li>
<li>Group - if this contact card should be added to a previously uploaded 
contact list, you can manually specify the name of that list here.</li>
<li>Notes - any other information about this address card that you want 
to add. This information is only shown to administrators.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bulk Imports</h3>

<p>When you upload a list of contacts as a CSV file, you can
automatically add the list to your list of saved contact lists, simply
by providing a name for the saved list.</p>

<p>Uploaded contacts can be entered into the address book in three ways:</p>

<ol>

<li> <b>simple contacts</b> - these are just plain old address cards that are 
not associated with any other data in the system.</li>

<li> <b>accounts</b> - each uploaded contact will have an account created in 
their name. Accounts are used by e-commerce and billing systems. If you
create accounts, you will be able to find these persons in financial tools
like the POS and Payments modules.</li>

<li> <b>members/users</b> - each uploaded contact will have a login identity
created in their name. This will allow them to access member-only areas
of your website. (This will also create an account in their name as well.)</li>

</ol>

<p>Contacts can be tagged with a group name, so that they can easily
be grouped together into contact lists under that name. Uploaded lists
will automatically be tagged with a group name based on the name of
the uploaded file, unless you select a different group name to tag
them with. If you select one of the known group names, you will be
adding this uploaded list to the existing group.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>If you collect names and email addresses for a subscription list on
your website, those can be added to the address book with a group name
of "subscription". To manually add to this subscription database, you
can add individual address cards, with a group name of "subscription",
or you can upload a list of contacts, and select "subscription" from
the group code drop-down. (The drop-down shows all known group codes, so
if you don't have any subscriptions yet, you will have to type it into
the text field instead.)</p>
