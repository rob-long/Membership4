<h1>Publish Tool</h1>

<p>The publish tool is just a shortcut for the publish functions that are
built-in to several other web applications.  It searches your websites 
and web applications and gives you links to publish each of them.</p>

<p>To publish the files that are associated with a website, click on the 
website's icon.  Website icons look like folders.</p>

<p>To publish the files that are associated with a web application,
click on the web application's icon.  Most web applications do not
have their own files, and will not be shown here.  Some web
applications will have uploaded files, however -- especially those
that allow you to include images or documents.  These web applications
may have some built-in publishing functions to allow you to publish
these files for better performance.</p>

<p>Published websites or applications will open a new window, listing 
files as they are published to disk.  If any web pages are published, you may
click on the web page filenames to visit the published version.  Note that 
browser caching may still be saving previous versions of the published files.
You may have to force a reload of the page to see the newly published 
version.</p>
