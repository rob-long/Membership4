<h1>Blogs</h1>

<p>A <em>blog</em> is a collection of articles or posts that are
presented in time sequence, most-recent first. This format is useful
for:</p>

<ul>
<li>news &amp; announcements</li>
<li>online magazines (e-zines)</li>
<li>journals &amp; logs (the term <em>blog</em> comes from "web-log")</li>
<li>columns</li>
<li>any other content where recent items are more timely or important than old items</li>
</ul>

<p>The blog itself is a <em>container</em> for the posts that are made
to it. Think of the blog as a magazine, and the posts as articles in that
magazine. The blog title is the name of the magazine, and the post
titles are the titles of the individual articles.</p>

<p>When starting a new blog, select a title that will
describe <em>ALL</em> of the posts that will be made. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>News</li>
<li>Recent Developments</li>
<li>Industry Notices</li>
<li>...or just plain "Blog" :-)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have two or more major subject areas and you don't want to
mix them together, set up a different blog for each.</p>

<p>To post to or otherwise work on a blog, select the blog by clicking
on its name.</p>

<a name="blogtools"></a><h2>Blog Tools</h2>

<p>When viewing a blog, you will see a few tools, and a list of all
the articles that have been posted. There are pagination tools and
search box if the number of articles is high. Click on the article
title <a href="#arttools">to work on that particular article</a>, or
click the preview link to view it on your website.</p>

<p>The toolbar has the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>post a new article - use this to start a new post</li>
<li>configure blog - use this to change your blog's name, or change its settings</li>
<li>search all posts - look for an older post by searching its contents for keywords</li>
<li>publish - republishes the whole blog, including archives and RSS feeds</li>
<li>delete blog - erases this blog <strong>and all of its posts</strong> from your website</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> there are two search tools available. <em>Search all
posts</em> works like a search engine, and will look through your past
articles looking for keywords, and ordering them by
relevance. The <em>Search:</em> box above the article list filters
that list to include rows containing only the word or phrase that you
type.</p>

<a name="arttools"></a><h2>Article Tools</h2>

<p>When you click into an article, you will see an article preview,
and a number of tools to work on the article:</p>

<ul>
<li>edit - make revisions to the article content</li>
<li>configure - change the article title or other settings</li>
<li>preview - view the article on your website</li>
<li>images - manage any images that are included in the article</li>
<li>tags - update any keywords that the article has been tagged with</li>
<li>metadata - update metadata that are used to describe your article on other services such as social media</li>
<li>share - share the article on social media (the article must be published before you can share it)</li>
<li>schedule - you can schedule posts to go live or archive themselves here</li>
<li>workflow tools - these allow you to publish, archive, and cancel posts manually</li>
<li>delete - erase the article from your website</li>
</ul>

<h3>Editing &amp Configuring Articles</h3>

<p>When editing articles, you have a full editor with a suite of
formatting tools. You can embed links, images, videos, and other
content in the usual ways. Note, however, that articles generally have
a standard format for presenting text and images together. Use
the <a href="#images">images tool</a> to add images in this standard
format.</p>

<p>When configuring articles, you can update titles, link text, and
URL segments. Note that if you change the name that is used in the
URL, then old links and bookmarks can break and give <em>404 Not
Found</em> errors.</p>

<p>You can optionally define an <b>abstract</b> (short
summary), an <b>author</b> (if you need to give special credit to the
writer), and a <b>footnote</b> (if you need to include references,
credits, notes, or corrections at the end).</p>

<p>If you opt to make an article <b>sticky</b>, the article will
always be positioned above other articles, even if that puts them out
of sequence. Sticky articles are tagged with a star <span class="fa
fa-star"></span> in the blog control panel. Stickiness can be
configured system-wide to be permanent or temporary. Permanent
stickiness means the article will remain there forever (until you
un-set the sticky flag, or manually archive or delete the
article). Temporary stickiness (which is the default) means the
article will remain on top as long as it is one of the <i>current</i>
articles in the blog. Once it naturally ages into the archives, it
will disappear from the index.</p>

<a name="images"></a><h3>Article Images</h3>

<p>For the sake of consistency and tidiness, articles generally follow
a standard format in which a primary image is displayed near the top
of the article (often to the right, with a caption), and any
additional images are displayed at the end in a thumbnail
gallery. This format prevents your article listing from becoming too
confusing and scattered, making it easier to identify important
information at a glance.</p>

<p>Use the <b>images</b> tool to upload and manage your images. You
can add any number of images to the article. The topmost image is
the <em>primary image</em> which will be displayed at the top. All of
the remaining images will be shown at the end of the article. To
change which is the primary image, drag the images into a new order,
and click "save order".</p>

<p>If the standard format doesn't work, then you can always insert
images manually, using the standard CMS insert image function. If you
want to embed images, but not have them included in the standard image
displays at the top and bottom of the article, then select images from
a library or album elsewhere on your website, and place any new images
in one of those libraries.</p>

<a name="workflow"></a><h3>Publishing and Workflow</h3>

<p>After you have entered your article text, you have a number of
options for saving the article:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>save</b> - this saves your article in an approved state, which
means it is ready to be published. Publishing is done in a separate
step. This allows you to preview, make corrections, upload images, or
perform other website changes before you publish.</li>

<li><b>save as draft</b> - this keeps your article in a working state,
and it will not be published accidentally if someone publishes the
site.</li>

<li><b>save &amp; publish</b> - this saves your article and publishes
it in one step, if you are sure it is ready to go.</li>

</ul>

<p>After an article has been saved, you have additional workflow
options that are available to you, which may include any of the
following, depending on the article's current status:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>publish</b> - takes the article public, and writes out any
files that need to be written to the web server.</li>

<li><b>re-publish</b> - re-writes any files, if you revise an article
or its images after the original was already published.</li>

<li><b>archive</b> - moves the article off the current articles index,
and disables any addtional functions like comments, but keeps the
article available for public viewing.</li>

<li><b>approve</b> - approves the article as ready to publish, but
does not publish it yet.</li>

<li><b>queue</b> - puts the article into the publish queue, to be
automatically published in the near future.</li>

<li><b>draft</b> - un-publishes the article, and puts it back into a
draft state for further revision.</li>

<li><b>submit</b> - submits a draft for approval by reviewers/moderators.</li>

<li><b>cancel</b> - un-publishes the article, removing it from the
public website.</li>

<li><b>reject</b> - opposite of approve; marks the article as
unsuitable for publication, and a candidate for deletion.</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition to these manual workflow functions, you also have the
ability to <b>schedule</b> your posts to be published at certain times
of day. Use the schedule tool to set the publication time. Queuing and
scheduling operations generally run once per hour, so the actual
publication time will be within 1 hour of the selected time. You can
also schedule articles to be archived in a similar way.</p>

<p>You can only schedule draft or approved articles for
publication. Note that approved articles may be manually published
before the scheduled time.</p>

<div class="panel panel-default panel-primary
box-large"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">What is
the difference between queuing and
scheduling?</h3></div><div class="panel-body"><b>Scheduling</b> can be
used to configure your post to be published on a precise
date. <b>Queuing</b>, on the other hand, will publish it "later". More
specifically, it means "publish this soon, but not right now, and
don't publish everything all at once". This is a good way to take a
large number of items live, but spread them out over time so that your
website is constantly refreshing with new content.</div></div>

<h3>Archives</h3>

<p>Your regular blog index will show the most current articles. It
will only show a limited number (10, for example), and will only show
articles up to a certain age (90 days, for example). Articles over and
above these limits are not shown on the front page of the blog, but
can still be found in the archives.</p>

<p>The archives listing links to all of your posts, and is organized
by date. As with your regular blog index, articles that have been
hidden from indexes will not be shown in your archives.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> there are two senses of the
term <em>archived</em>, which can cause confusion:</p>

<ol>

<li>Articles that have expired off your regular blog index are still
available in the blog "archives", which is just a listing of older
articles. However, if those articles have a status of published, they
will still accept comments, for instance. In this case they are really
just pseudo-archived.</li>

<li>Articles that have been explicitly set to <em>archived</em> status
will stop accepting comments, and will disappear from the main index
as well. These are fully archived.</li>

</ol>
