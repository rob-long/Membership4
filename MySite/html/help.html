<h1>My Website</h1>

<p><i><b>My Website</b></i> provides a simple 
and friendly way to manage your web page content.</p>

<p>Your website control panel opens with a site map of all of your
pages, and page-like locations (such as blogs and calendars),
organized into their menus and sub-menus. Use the arrows at the left
to expand/contract submenus. Your current active pages are shown with
bold text; others are shown greyed-out. Click on the
page name to open up a <a href="#page">smaller control panel just for
that page</a>.</p>

<a name=site></a><h2>Website Management Tools</h2>

<p>Above the site map are some general options for your website in general:</p>

<ul>

<li>configure site - use this to set your site title and
URL. <span class=error>Do not change your URL casually! You must also
update your webserver configuration to recognize this URL.</span> You
can also specify a description here, which can be helpful for some
search engines.</li>

<li>new page - this adds a new page into your site map. It will be
blank to start with.</li>

<li>change menu oder - this jumps to the <b>Menu</b> module, which allows you
to re-order your pages and menu structure.</li>

<li>photos - this jumps to the <b>Photo Albums</b> module, which
allows you to manage your images.</li>

<li>documents - this jumps to the <b>Documents</b> module, which
allows you to manage your documents, and other downloadable files.</li>

<li>publish - this takes all of your changes live. Use this after you
are done with your edits. <span class=warn>If you do not publish, the
public will not see your changes.</span></li>

</ul>

<a name=page></a><h2>Page Overview</h2>

<p>After clicking on a page name, a smaller control panel will open to
inspect and manage that page. Click on the X or anywhere outside this
control panel to return to the main website control panel.</p>

<p>A <a href="#pagetools">toolbar to manage the page</a> is shown at top,
followed by information about the page underneath:</p>

<ul>

<li>Type - for example, page, blog, calendar, etc.</li>

<li>Status - should be <span class=help>published</span> for active
pages, but may be set to something else for old out of date pages, or
new pages that haven't been published yet.</li>

<li>Language - the language of the page, for multi-lingual sites. For
single language sites, this will be blank.</li>

<li>Menu label - this is how the page appears in menu links.</li>

<li>Path - this is how the page appears in the URL, after the domain name.</li>

<li>URL - the full address of the web page. Click here to go to the
webpage as it currently appears to the public.</li>

</ul>

<p>For non-page locations, like blogs and calendars, it will also
offer a link to manage their contents (ie. the posts to a blog, and
the events in the calendar). Editing a blog or calendar directly using
My Site will edit <i>preamble</i> text that will be displayed above
the posts, but will not edit the individual posts or events
themselves.</p>

<a name=preview></a><h3>Previewing Pages</h3>

<p>Click the preview tool to open up a preview of your page in a new tab/window.</p>

<p>As the site administrator, you will see the editable region of
content highlighted by a dashed red line.  At the bottom of the
editable region is an edit button.  Click this button
to <a href=#edit>edit</a> the outlined content.  (Regular website
users will not see the dashed line or edit button.)</p>

<p>To return to the control panel, simply close the preview window or
click the "done" button.</p>

<p class="error">Do not copy/paste or use the web address of the
preview page. It is an administrator preview, and will not work for
regular website visitors. Instead, copy the URL from the <a href="#page">page
information</a> on the control panel.</p>

<a name=edit></a><h3>Editing Pages</h3>

<p>There are two ways to edit a web page:</p>

<ol>
<li> click on the edit tool in the control panel.</li>
<li> <a href="#preview">preview the page</a>, and then click on the edit button at the bottom of the page.</li>
</ol>

<p>In either case, the web page is displayed in a separate window,
with the content region replaced by a full <a href="#editor">HTML
editor</a>, which you can type into to make your changes.</p>

<p>When done making changes, click on the "Submit" button below the
editor.  This will return to the page preview, and you should be able
to see your new changes with the surrounding page style applied.  If
everything looks good, click done, and you should find
yourself back at your website control panel.</p>

<p class=error><b>Warning:</b> if you click reload, or navigate away from 
the page while editing, your changes so far will be lost.</p>

<a name=publish></a><h3>Publish Page</h3>

<p>When your are happy with your edits, publish them using the publish
tool. This will publish that one page only.</p>

<p>If you are making numerous changes, or you have created new pages
that will change the menus on every page, it will be simpler to use
the <a href="#site">website publish tool</a> when all your changes are
ready.</p>

<p>Because web browsers will cache pages, visitors may not see the
changes immediately. A force-refresh will usually fetch the latest
update.</p>

<a name=pconf></a><h3>Configuring Pages</h3>

<p>Use the page configuration tool to modify the setup of your web pages.</p>

<ul>
<li>title - this changes the title of the page</li>

<li>name - this is the part of the URL address that refers to your
page. It should consist of only letters, numbers, and punctuation
characters like _ or -.</li>

<li>label - this is used for links and menus</li>

<li>parent - this positions the page under the selected page in the
site map. It is a simple way to move your page around.</li>

<li>template - use this to select a special graphic design that should
be used for this page, if the default design is not appropriate.</li>

<li>language - select the language of the page, if not the default (English)</li>

<li>sortkey - this controls the order of the page, within its submenu.</li>

<li>access - use this to set who may view this page. Anyone else will
get a login form.</li>

<li>hide from - you can keep this webpage out of menus, sitemaps, and
search indexes by using these settings.</li>

<li>publish rule - this controls if/how your page will be
published. You do not need to set this, as a reasonable setting will
be chosen automatically.</li>

<li>status - <span class=help>published</span> pages are your
website's normal, active pages. Everything else is disabled to varying
degrees.</li>

<li>description - this may be used by some search engines to describe this page.</li>

<li>keywords - this may be used by some search engines to describe this page.</li>

</ul>

<a name=rollback></a><h3>Rollbacks</h3>

<p>To undo changes that were made to a web page, use the rollback
tool. This deletes the most recent revision of the content, and
replaces it with the previous version on file.  (There is no preset
limit to how many versions are saved, or how far you can roll
back.)</p>

<p>You should also <a href=#publish>re-publish</a> the page, or public
viewers of the site will continue to see the old version.</p>

<p class=error><b>Warning:</b> There is no "redo" function to undo a
rollback.  Once you have rolled back, the lost revisions are put into
the trash. They can be recovered from there, however.</p>

<a name=del></a><h3>Deleting Pages</h3>

<p>To remove a page from your site completely, click on the page delete 
tool.</p>

<p class=error>Deleting a page also deletes all the pages in the
submenus underneath it. Deleting the home page will effectively delete
THE ENTIRE WEBSITE. Although deleted items can be recovered from the
trash, if you delete too much at once, you can overflow the trash, and
the deleted items may no be recoverable.</p>

<a name=editor></a><h2>HTML Editor</h2>

<p>When editing pages, you have the use of a multi-function WYSIWYG
HTML editor to assist you with formatting. It includes numerous
word-processor like functions to set text styles, headings, lists,
tables, links, images, and more.</p>

<p class=error>The text style in the editor does not exactly match
your website styles. You must submit to have the results displayed in
your website's styles. Do not fuss with your layout too much, as it
will look different on different types of screens and devices.</p>

<h3>Adding Links</h3>

<p>Use the link tool to add hyperlinks to your page. Highlight the
text you want to serve as the link anchor, and then click the link
tool to choose the link destination:</p>

<ul>

<li>URL - use this to link to 3rd-party web pages.</li>

<li>Internal Page - select a page from your website. This link will work even
if you move the page around or rename it.</li>

<li>Image/Document - select a library, and any file in it to make a
link directly to that download.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Inserting Media</h3>

<p>Use the images tool to insert an image straight from one of your
libraries or albums.</p>

<p>If the image you want to display is not on your website, use the URL tab in the image dialog to specify an external image.</p>

<p>If the image does not exist on your website yet, use the upload tab
to put it there, before adding it to your page. When uploading an
image, you can place it in the current page, or into a library if you
think you might want to re-use it elsewhere.</p>

<p>More complicated media (such as YouTube videos, SoundCloud audio,
and other so-called <em>embeds</em>) can be inserted using
the <b>Insert media</b> tool under the Insert menu.</p>

<h3>Inserting Applications</h3>

<p>Your website has special applications installed in it, many of
which can be embedded into web pages. Select the application you want
to embed using the <b>Insert Application</b> tool under the insert
menu. Then choose the application you want to insert, and set any
special options that the application wants.</p>
