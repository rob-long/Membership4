The StoreAdm plug-in is used to manage the contents of your persistent
data store, if you have one.

You must enable the Store in cgi/Local.pm to use this plug-in.

This plug-in also supports the following scheduled tasks:
command=rebuild - reclaims disk space
command=reset - clears store contents
command=purge - clears expired items
command=delete, id=storeID - clears a specific item from store
