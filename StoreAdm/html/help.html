<h1>Persistent Data Store</h2>

<p>The persistent data store is a small, fast database used by various
components that require short-term data persistence, or fast data
access.  It is an optional feature used for session management,
database caching, and storing system configurations.  By default it is
not enabled; see the <a href="#enabling">end of this document</a> for
instructions on turning this feature on.  When on, this application
can be used to peek inside the persistent data store, inspect items,
and remove items.</p>

<p>Every item in the store can be given an expiry time, after which it
will be automatically purged from the store.  Expiry times default to
1 hour, but can be set to other times, indefinite (no expiry), or
renewed/updated as needed.</p>

<h2>Store Inventory</h2>

<p>This is a list of all items in the store.  The size (in bytes) is
shown, and the administrator has links to inspect or clear (delete)
the item.  Some items (cached items, configurations) will automatically
be reloaded if they are needed, so they may reappear after you delete 
them.</p>

<p>The item name gives some indication of its purpose:</p>

<dl>

<dt><b>_id</b></dt>
<dd>This is the store identity (should be the location of the
cgi-bin directory).  The store will not run if this does not match
the actual working directory, so do not clear this item!</dd>

<dt><b>_log</b></dt> <dd>If store logging is enabled, this contains a
log of important transactions with the store.  Inspect this to see a
summary of recent store activity.  This may be useful in a development
environment, but is probably just a performance drag in a production
setting.</dd>

<dt><b>cache:...</b></dt>
<dd>These are cached query results from the database.  Inspect these
to see the actual database data.  They will typically persist for up
to 1 hour, before being automatically cleaned out.  It is a good idea
to clear the cache if you make any manual changes to the database,
otherwise the website may not see those changes.</dd>

<dt><b>session:...</b></dt>
<dd>These are individual users' sessions.  Inspect these to see their
session data.  Sessions are renewed if the user remains active on the
site, but expire if activity ceases (typically after 1 hour).  If you
clear a session, that user's session state is erased/reset. 
If session-based authentication is used, it will also log them out.</dd>

<dt><b>config:...</b></dt> 

<dd>These are data structures describing the system configuration.
The base system configuration is kept in <b>config:</b>, and the
configurations of various plugins are kept in <b>config:[Module]</b>.
ExSite keeps copies handy in the store so that it does not have to
reload and reparse the configuration files on every request.  If you
clear these, ExSite will reload them from the originals; you should do
this if you change the configuration files, or the changes will not be
seen.</dd>

<dt><b>dbmap:...</b></dt>
<dd>These are data structures describing the database configuration.  
The base dbmaps are kept in <b>dbmap:[database_name]</b>, while 
submaps for various plugins are kept in <b>dbmap:[Module]</b>.
ExSite keeps copies handy in the store so that it does not have to 
reload and reparse the dbmap files on every request.  If you clear 
these, ExSite will reload them from the originals; you should do this 
if you change the dbmap, or the changes will not be seen.</dd>

</dl>

<p>There may be other items in the store as well, but they are not
described here.</p>

<p>The toolbar at the top of the store has the following buttons:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Reset store</b>: clears all stored data, excluding items beginning with leading underscores.</li>
<li><b>Clear dbmap</b>: clears all dbmap configurations, forcing them to be reloaded.</li>
<li><b>Clear session</b>: erases all user sessions.</li>
<li><b>Clear config</b>: clears all configurations, forcing them to be reloaded.</li>
<li><b>Clear cache</b>: clears all cached database queries, forcing the system to go back to the database.</li>
<li><b>Refresh</b>: refresh the store inventory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Inspecting Items</h2>

<p>Click the inspect buttons to see what is actually contained in an
item in the store.  The structure of the resulting data will vary
depending on what you are looking at.</p>

<p>The expiry time of the item is noted above the data, as MM:SS.
Some items do not expire, and will be noted as such.  Items that have
passed their expiry time are noted as EXPIRED, but will not actually
be removed until the next time the store goes through a round of
garbage collection.  (The time until the next round of garbage
collection is noted at the bottom of the store inventory.)</p>

<h2>Enabling the Store</h2>

<p>Why should you enable the store?</p>

<ul>

<li> it improves performance by caching frequently used data, and reducing
load on your database server</li>

<li> it increases your website's throughput capacity (number of pages
served per second), and ability to withstand DOS attacks,
traffic spikes, and badly-behaved robots</li>

<li> it enables the use of sessions to track the state of a user's visit</li>

</ul>

<p>However, there are a few reasons why you might not want to use the
store:</p>

<ul>

<li> it is slightly more complicated to tinker with or modify the system
configuration, which can be annoying in a development environment</li>

<li> it creates an extra store database file in your web directories,
which can grow to become large if it not rebuilt or reset
periodically</li>

<li> database caching can cause data integrity problems if your
databases are also being updated by other agents (people or programs)
that don't employ ExSite's caching tools, since the cache will not
reflect those 3rd-party updates</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that all of these issues can be mitigated by manual
intervention, to clear affected items, reset the store, or rebuild the
store database.  (However, manual intervention is not always possible
or practical.)  If you decide that the benefits outweight the
disadvantages, you need to do the following things to enable the
store:</p>

<ol>

<li> Edit <code>Local::store_conf()</code> to set your store
configuration parameters.  Remove "<code>_disabled</code>" from the
routine name to ensure that the configuration is picked up by the
system.</li>

<li> Run the following command from your website's cgi-bin to
initialize the store database:

<pre>
../bin/store.pl --reset
</pre>

</li>

<li>Then re-launch this application (or refresh its window) to see the
activated store contents.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Rebuilding the Store</h2>

<p>The store is built on a GDBM database.  This type of database grows
in size, but never shrinks unless you tell it to.  That means your
store will grow in size and become very large if you do not
periodically rebuild it.</p>

<p>To manually rebuild the store, use the following command from the
shell (execute from your CGI-BIN directory):</p>

<pre>
../bin/store.pl --rebuild
</pre>

<h2>Automating Store Management</h2>

<p>To rebuild the store automatically, use the system Task Manager to
set up a recurring task with the following parameters:</p>

<p>
<b>Name:</b> Rebuild store<br>
<b>Module:</b> StoreAdm<br>
<b>Command:</b> rebuild<br>
<b>Method:</b> daily or weekly
</p>

<p>High-traffic sites should rebuild the store at least daily.
Lower-traffic sites can do it weekly.  In principle you can rebuild hourly,
but rebuilding will lock your store up for a number of seconds, and you may
not want to do this during high-traffic periods.</p>

<p>Note that you can also setup other automatic store management tasks
in a similar way, by changing some of the above parameters, for example:</p>

<p>
<b>Name:</b> Clear everything in store<br>
<b>Command:</b> reset
</p>

<p>
<b>Name:</b> Delete [item]<br>
<b>Command:</b> delete<br>
<b>ID:</b> [store item name]
</p>

<p>The last one can be used to effectively expire some permanent items
and force them to be reloaded periodically.  For example, if you
delete <b>config:</b> on an hourly basis, then your system
configuration will automatically get reloaded once per hour.</p>
