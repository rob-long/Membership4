<h1>Trash</h1>

<p>The Trash bin provides temporary storage of deleted data.
To see what is in the trash, launch the Trash app.</p>

<p>Your trash is displayed with brief descriptions, and with most
recently deleted items at the top. The listing is paginated and
searchable. You can reorder the listing by clicking on headings.</p>

<p>To view a trash item in detail, click the <b>inspect</b> tool. This
will display the raw data of each of the records in that trash
item. Use the <b>recover</b> tool to restore those records from the
trash and return them to the database.</p>

<p>Most trash is true garbage, and it is useful to empty it from time
to time to reduce your database and backup size. The tools at the top
give you three options for emptying the trash manually:</p>

<ul>
<li>empty my trash - discards things that <i>you</i> deleted</li>
<li>empty old trash - discards trash that is older than a certain amount (usually 90 days)</li>
<li>empty ALL trash - discards everything</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, a garbage collector take out the trash automatically
at set intervals. If this is the case on your system, your trash bin
will be emptied periodically without your intervention.  Don't leave
anything in the Trash for long, if you might need it later!</p>
